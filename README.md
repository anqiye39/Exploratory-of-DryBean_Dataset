Project Overview: Dry Bean Variety Analysis Using Machine Learning
1. Introduction and Background
   Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy, and the precise classification of crop varieties is essential for quality control, trade standardization, and high-yield breeding programs. Traditionally, identifying specific varieties of dry beans is a manual process that is time-consuming, expensive, and subject to human subjectivity and error.This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) to automate and enhance this process. By analyzing morphological data—specifically the dimensions and shapes of beans—we aimed to develop models that can objectively distinguish between seven registered dry bean varieties. The study operates through three interconnected lenses: predictive modeling (classification), inherent data structure discovery (clustering), and feature interpretation to identify the morphological drivers of varietal differences.
2. Dataset Description
   The study utilizes the Dry Bean Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising 13,611 observations of dry beans grown in Turkey. The target variable is the bean variety, consisting of seven classes: Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, and Sira.
   The dataset includes 16 continuous numerical features extracted from images, which are categorized into two groups:Size-Related Features: Attributes defining scale, such as Area, Perimeter, and Major Axis Length7.Shape-Related Features: Attributes describing geometric form independent of scale, such as Aspect Ratio, Roundness, Eccentricity, and ShapeFactors (1-4).
   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed a class imbalance, with "Dermason" being the most frequent (3,546 samples) and "Bombay" the least frequent (522 samples). A correlation analysis showed extreme collinearity among size features ($r > 0.95$), suggesting significant redundancy and strong geometric constraints within the data0.
3. Methodology
   The project workflow was divided into data preprocessing, unsupervised learning, supervised classification, feature importance analysis, and regression tasks.Preprocessing:The data was split into a 70% training set and a 30% test set. To address the varying magnitudes of features (e.g., Area in thousands vs. ShapeFactors in decimals), all continuous features were standardized using a StandardScaler.
   Unsupervised Learning:Before labeled training, we applied clustering algorithms—K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Spectral Clustering—to validate if the data possessed a natural structure consistent with the bean varieties. Performance was evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
   Supervised Classification:We trained four distinct classifiers to predict the bean variety:Logistic Regression (LR): To test for linear separability15.Support Vector Machine (SVM): Utilizing an RBF kernel for non-linear boundaries.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based baseline.Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): A probabilistic baseline.Models were optimized using GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
   Feature Importance Analysis:To ensure interpretability, we employed Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). This model-agnostic technique ranks features based on how much the model's performance drops when a feature's values are randomly shuffled20.Regression:We assessed the ability to predict continuous variables, specifically Area (size) and Roundness (shape). A Logarithmic Transformation was applied to the targets to stabilize variance. Models included Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, SVR, and KNN.
4. Key Results
   Classification Performance:The supervised models achieved high accuracy, demonstrating that morphological features are highly discriminative.SVM achieved the highest performance with a CV Macro-F1 score of 0.945124.Logistic Regression followed closely with an F1 score of 0.937125.The success of linear models like Logistic Regression confirms that the dataset is highly linearly separable in high-dimensional space. Confusion matrices showed that while distinct varieties like "Bombay" were identified perfectly, some overlap occurred between morphologically similar varieties like "Sira" and "Dermason".
   Clustering Insights:Unsupervised learning showed moderate success. K-Means achieved an ARI of 0.6689, successfully separating distinct groups but struggling with overlapping boundaries compared to supervised methods. This indicates that while intrinsic structure exists, labels are necessary for precise differentiation.Feature Interpretability:A critical finding from the Global Permutation Importance analysis was the dominance of shape over size. ShapeFactor1 was identified as the most influential feature for classification, followed by Roundness. This suggests that geometric proportions are more reliable indicators of variety than raw size, which can vary due to environmental factors.
   Regression and Geometric Rules:For regression tasks, applying a log transformation was transformative.Area Prediction: Linear Regression achieved a near-perfect $R^2$ of 0.999930. This implies that "Area" is redundant and can be mathematically derived from other features with high precision.Roundness Prediction: Linear Regression also performed best ($R^2 = 0.994$), outperforming complex non-linear models like Random Forest ($R^2 = 0.93$).
5. Discussion and Conclusion
   This project successfully demonstrated that Machine Learning can automate the classification of dry beans with over 92% accuracy, providing a viable low-cost solution for agricultural quality grading.The analysis revealed that the dataset follows strict geometric rules, allowing linear models to perform exceptionally well. The study also highlighted the importance of Feature Engineering (such as log transformations) over model complexity.
   Limitations: The study faced challenges regarding class imbalance, with models potentially biased toward majority classes like Dermason36. Additionally, the reliance solely on morphological data ignores other quality factors like color and texture.
   Future Work: Future iterations should incorporate Deep Learning (CNNs) to analyze raw images directly, capturing texture and color data. Furthermore, implementing local interpretability tools like SHAP or LIME would help explain individual misclassifications, improving transparency for agricultural practitioners39.
