This study investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) to automate the classification of seven dry bean varieties using morphological data. Utilizing the UCI Dry Bean Dataset (13,611 samples), we analyzed 16 geometric features through unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. The results demonstrate high predictive performance, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieving the highest accuracy (CV Macro-F1: 0.9451) and Logistic Regression confirming strong linear separability within the data. Feature importance analysis revealed that shape-related attributes, specifically ShapeFactors and Roundness, are the primary drivers of varietal differentiation, significantly outweighing raw size measurements. Furthermore, regression models predicting bean Area and Roundness achieved near-perfect precision after logarithmic transformation, highlighting the strict geometric constraints of the dataset. This project confirms that ML models offer an objective, efficient, and low-cost solution for agricultural quality control and breeding programs.
